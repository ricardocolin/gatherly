##Run the application:
    access the back-end folder 
        -> npm run dev   //this will trigger the front-end and back-end ports
        
        
##Issues:
    Keep getting a "Unauthrized Error" when trying to communicate from front-end to back-end
    I manage to get the long URLS to a small ones and saved them in a MongoDB through the back-end
    Front-end does pass the website value but would not trigger the database, I tried multiple ways to communicate from both ports but was unsuccessful. I managed to print the new shorten URL in the command line when passing the value.
